# Programming Practice Assignment - Week 2 - Question 1

## Problem Statement

Create a file `documents.txt` containing all the possible file names in the format `file_XYZ.txt` where X is a lower case alphabet, Y is also a lower case alphabet and Z is a number between 0 and 4.

Hint: Use echo to solve this with a single command.

## Instructions

The file names in `documents.txt` should be separated by a single space.
Few examples of file names in this format are `file_dh3.txt`, `file_sd1.txt`, `file_ja0.txt`, `file_at2.txt`.
You do not need to create any script file for this. You can directly run the command in the terminal to create the file.
After the file is created you should run `synchro eval` to submit your solution.
