Write a `script.sh` that processes a CSV file `people.csv` containing names and ages, and outputs the names of people whose age is a multiple of 5. Use a for loop to process the file. Sample input and output is as follows.

**Note**
	- You will need to handle the header file appropriately.
	- The `people.csv` is given as standard input.

**Sample Input**

```
Name,Age

Jane Smith,22
Alice Johnson,25
Bob Brown,45
```

**Sample Output**

```
John Doe
Alice Johnson
Bob Brown
```
