A company has 5 departments, each named `Dept1` to `Dept5`. Within each department, there are 3 teams labeled `TeamA` to `TeamC`. Each team works on 10 projects.

There is a directory for every team in `~/se2001/BPT1_problem_1/`.

**Write Bash command(s) to create a file for each project, with the files named from `project1` to `project10`, in every team directory. Each file should be empty to ensure minimal space usage.**

**Note** Please run synchro init command before you start working on your solution.
